# Learnathon Program

The Learnathon program, initiated by [CodeWave Hub](https://codewavehub.tech/), is an open-source chapter dedicated to fostering students' enthusiasm for technology.

## Overview

In this repository, you'll find my learning journey as I delve into Python from scratch. The progress will be organized into day-wise folders, allowing you to track my learning process.

Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or join the CodeWave Hub community!
